    "ACH-000977": "1.Cell type and origin: Prostate adenocarcinoma cell line derived from a metastatic lesion in the left supraclavicular lymph node of a 50-year-old male patient.2.Molecular signatures: Androgen receptor (AR) positive with AR amplification; expresses mutant AR (T878A); harbors PTEN deletion and TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion; exhibits PSA (KLK3) expression.3.Signaling pathways: Androgen receptor signaling is constitutively active; PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway hyperactivated due to PTEN loss; MAPK pathway signaling present; responsive to steroid hormone stimuli.4.Known drug response profiles: Androgen-dependent growth, sensitive to anti-androgens (e.g., enzalutamide) and AR signaling inhibitors; exhibits resistance to taxanes upon progression; model for castration-resistant progression studies.\n5.\nCellular microenvironment: Grows as adherent epithelial clusters in vitro; lacks native stromal or immune components in standard culture conditions; used in co-culture models to study bone metastasis interactions.6.Key biomarkers: Androgen receptor is the primary therapeutic target; PSA (KLK3) secretion serves as a treatment response marker; PTEN loss is a prognostic biomarker; TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is a disease-specific marker.",
    "ACH-000202": "1.Cell type and origin: Colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line derived from a primary tumor of the colon in a 55-year-old male patient.2.Molecular signatures: Harbors a homozygous nonsense mutation in APC; exhibits MYC amplification and overexpression; expresses mutant p53 (R273H); negative for microsatellite instability (MSS).3.Signaling pathways: Constitutive activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling due to APC loss; dysregulated cell cycle progression via MYC overexpression; MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways are active.4.Known drug response profiles: Sensitive to inhibitors of Wnt signaling and MYC-targeting compounds; exhibits resistance to 5-fluorouracil and other conventional chemotherapies; used in models for targeting MYC-driven cancers.5.Cellular microenvironment: Grows in semi-adherent clusters and suspension in vitro; lacks native stromal or immune components in standard culture; used in xenograft models for colorectal cancer progression.6.Key biomarkers: MYC oncoprotein is a primary therapeutic target; APC mutation is a key driver alteration; β-catenin accumulation serves as a pathway activation marker."
