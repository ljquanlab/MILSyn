Chemical Structure Characteristics  3-Deazaneplanocin (DZNep) is a cyclopentenyl analog of adenosine with the molecular formula C11H14N4O3 and a molecular weight of 250.26 g/mol. Key functional groups include a primary amine (-NH2) on the pyrimidine ring, hydroxyl groups (-OH) on the cyclopentenyl moiety, and a secondary alcohol. The structure features a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system (purine analog) and a cyclopentenyl sugar mimic.  2. Known Molecular Targets and Pathways  DZNep primarily targets histone methyltransferases, specifically inhibiting the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) by depleting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a catalytic subunit of PRC2.

    "CCC1(O)C(=O)OCc2c1cc1n(c2=O)Cc2cc3ccccc3nc2-1": "1. Chemical Structure Characteristics  Camptothecin (C20H16N2O4) is a quinoline alkaloid with a molecular weight of 348.35 g/mol. Its structure includes a pentacyclic ring system with a lactone ring (essential for activity), a pyridine moiety, and a hydroxyl group at position 20. The lactone ring is pH-sensitive, existing in equilibrium with its carboxylate form under physiological conditions.  2. Known Molecular Targets and Pathways  Primary target: Topoisomerase I (TOP1). Camptothecin stabilizes the TOP1-DNA cleavage complex, preventing religation of single-strand DNA breaks. This leads to replication fork collision and double-strand breaks, triggering DNA damage response pathways (e.g., p53-mediated apoptosis).  3. Mechanism of Action in Human Biology  Camptothecin inhibits TOP1 by binding to the TOP1-DNA complex, trapping it in a covalent intermediate state. During DNA replication, this interference causes lethal DNA damage, selectively targeting rapidly dividing cells (e.g., cancer cells).  4. Pharmacokinetic Properties  - Absorption: Poor oral bioavailability due to instability at gastric pH (lactone ring hydrolysis). Typically administered intravenously.  - Distribution: Binds extensively to plasma proteins (e.g., albumin). High tissue distribution but limited CNS penetration.  - Metabolism: Hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4/5, forming inactive metabolites (e.g., hydroxylated derivatives).  - Excretion: Primarily renal (50\u201370%) and fecal (20\u201330%).  5. Common Therapeutic Applications  Used in oncology for:  - Colorectal cancer (e.g., irinotecan, a camptothecin analog).  - Ovarian and small cell lung cancer (e.g., topotecan).  - Investigational uses in glioblastoma and hematologic malignancies.  6. Reported Side Effects and Toxicity Profiles  - Hematologic: Severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia.  - Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea (dose-limiting), nausea, vomiting.  - Other: Fatigue, alopecia, hepatotoxicity.  - Unique toxicity: Cholinergic syndrome (with irinotecan).  7. Known Drug-Drug Interaction Patterns  - CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin): Reduce camptothecin efficacy by accelerating metabolism.  - CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): Increase toxicity by prolonging exposure.  - UGT1A1 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir): Exacerbate irinotecan-induced neutropenia/diarrhea.  - Anticoagulants: Enhanced bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia.",

Mechanism of Action in Human Biology  - Inhibits tyrosine kinase activity of ALK, ROS1, and MET by competitively binding to the ATP-binding site.  - Suppresses downstream oncogenic signaling, leading to reduced proliferation and survival of cancer cells.4. Pharmacokinetic Properties  - Absorption: Oral bioavailability ~43%, peak plasma concentration in 4\u20136 hours.  - Distribution: Extensive tissue distribution, protein binding ~91%.  - Metabolism: Primarily hepatic via CYP3A4/5 (major) and CYP1A2 (minor).  - Excretion: Predominantly fecal (63%), renal excretion (~22%).5. Common Therapeutic Applications  - FDA-Approved Indications: - ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) - ROS1-positive NSCLC  - Investigational Uses: - MET-amplified or exon 14-mutated cancers6. Reported Side Effects and Toxicity Profiles  - Common Adverse Effects: - Visual disturbances, nausea, diarrhea, edema, fatigue.  - Serious Adverse Effects: - Hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation, pneumonitis, bradycardia.7. Known Drug-Drug Interaction Patterns  - Strong CYP3A Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): \u2191 Crizotinib exposure (risk of toxicity).  - Strong CYP3A Inducers (e.g., rifampin): \u2193 Crizotinib efficacy.  - QT-Prolonging Drugs (e.g., amiodarone): Additive risk of arrhythmias.  - Acid-Reducing Agents (e.g., PPIs): May reduce absorption.
